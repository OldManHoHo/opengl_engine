# opengl_engine
minecraft clone with opengl from scratch

This is an old, failed attempt at a voxel engine.
Issues to learn from here:
- No design philosophy resulting in an insane game loop without good separation of rendering and behavior
- Poor documentation
- Bad modularization and optimization of OpenGL code
- Many many other things
